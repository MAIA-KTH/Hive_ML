**Hive-ML** is a Python Package collecting the tools and scripts to run Machine Learning experiments on Radiological
Medical Imaging.

## Install

To install Hive-ML:

```shell
pip install hive-ml
```

or :

```shell
conda install -c maia-kth hive-ml
```
or from GitHub:

```shell
git clone 
pip install -e Hive_ML
```

## Description

The **Hive-ML** workflow consists of several sequential steps, including *Radiomics extraction*,
*Sequential Forward Feature Selection*, and *Model Fitting*, reporting the classifier performances ( *ROC-AUC*,
*Sensitivity*,
*Specificity*, *Accuracy*) in a tabular format and tracking all the steps on an **MLFlow** server.

In addition, **Hive-ML** provides a *Docker Image*, *Kubernetes Deployment* and *Slurm Job*,
with the corresponding set of instructions to easily reproduce the experiments.

Finally, **Hive-ML** also support model serving through **MLFlow**, to provide easy access to the trained classifier
for future usage in model prediction.

In the tutorial explained below, Hive-ML is used to predict the Pathological Complete Response after a Neo-Adjuvant
chemotherapy, from DCE-MRI.

## Usage

![Hive-ML Pipeline](images/Radiodynamics_pipeline.png "Hive-ML Pipeline")
The Hive-ML workflow is controlled from a JSON configuration file, which the user can customize for each experiment run.

Example:

```json
    {
      "image_suffix": "_image.nii.gz",  # File suffix (or list of File suffixes) of the files containing the image volume.
      "mask_suffix": "_mask.nii.gz",    # File suffix (including file extension) of the files containing the segmentation mask of the ROI.
      "label_dict": {                   # Dictionary describing the classes. The key-value pair contains the label value as key (starting from 0) and the class description as value.
        "0": "non-pCR",
        "1": "pCR"
      },
      "models": {                       # Dictionary for all the classifiers to evaluate. Each element includes the classifier class name and an additional dictionary with the kwargs to pass to the classifier object.

### Perfusion Maps Generation

Given a 4D Volume, to extract the perfusion maps (``TTP``, ``CBV``, ``CBF``, ``MTT``) run:

```shell
 Hive_ML_generate_perfusion_maps -i </path/to/data_folder> --config-file <config_file.json>
```

Fore more details, follow the Jupyter Notebook
Tutorial : [Generate Perfusion Maps](tutorials/0-Generate_Perfusion_Maps.ipynb)

![Perfusion Maps](images/PMaps.png "Perfusion Maps")

### Feature Extraction

```shell
 Hive_ML_extract_radiomics --data-folder </path/to/data_folder> --config-file <config_file.json> --feature-param-file </path/to/radiomics_config.yaml --output-file </path/to/feature_file> 
```

### Feature Selection

To run Feature Selection:

```shell
 Hive_ML_feature_selection --feature-file </path/to/feature_file> --config-file <config_file.json> --experiment-name <EXPERIMENT_ID>
